## Current Progress
- Built the basic structure of the entire project.
- Able to start all services with `make dev` using Docker.

## Current Problem
- User registration issue: the GraphQL mutation for registration returns an HTTP 400 error.
- Likely cause: invalid or incorrectly formatted input parameters sent to the backend.
